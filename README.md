# House Price Prediction 

## Problem Statement
The real estate industry faces challenges in accurately predicting the sales prices of residential properties, making it difficult for homebuyers and sellers to make informed decisions. This project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts house prices. 

The evaluation metric for this task is **Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)**, calculated between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the actual sales price. This ensures fair error assessment across both expensive and inexpensive houses.

---

## Objective 
The goal is to develop a **robust predictive model** that accurately estimates house prices based on various features.

---

## Project Overview 
I developed and implemented a **Linear Regression** model to forecast house prices. The project involved **data preparation, visualization, and model evaluation** to ensure reliable predictions.

---

## Key Steps Taken 

### 1. Data Reading 
- Loaded **training** and **test** datasets for analysis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing 
- **Cleaning:** Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
- **Outlier Removal:** Identified and eliminated outliers to improve model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Adjusted and engineered features to enhance model performance.

### 3. Data Visualization 
- Used visualization techniques to understand data distributions and relationships.

### 4. Model Training 
- Applied **Linear Regression** on the training dataset.

### 5. Prediction & Evaluation 
- Made predictions on the test dataset.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared (R²)**
- Used **cross-validation** to ensure robust performance.
